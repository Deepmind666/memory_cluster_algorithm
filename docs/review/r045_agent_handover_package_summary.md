# R-045 Agent Handover Package Summary

## Goal
Move from engineering iteration to patent agent drafting handover, without expanding tests or review loops.

## Delivered
1. `docs/patent_kit/12_代理人交接包_一页纸.md`
2. `docs/patent_kit/13_代理人交接包_权利要求策略说明.md`
3. `docs/patent_kit/14_代理人交接包_证据索引与提交流程.md`
4. `docs/patent_kit/15_代理人沟通邮件模板.md`
5. `docs/patent_kit/00_技术交底书_总览.md` updated to include 12-15

## What This Enables
- Immediate package transfer to patent agent
- Clear claim-priority instruction (core vs optional)
- Direct traceability from claims to evidence mapping docs
- Reduced communication friction via reusable email template

## Notes
- This round intentionally skipped new testing/review cycles per user instruction.
- Focus was document readiness for CNIPA formal drafting by agent.
